  create azure cred # subid/tenid/clienid/clisec
  create azure secret engine with those cred, and cretae azure role with contributor and use with vault role
  - tf azurerm_resource_group (samg-jenkins)
  - tf vault_azure_secret_backend (azure)
  - tf vault_azure_secret_backend_role (jenkins)
  generate sample az cred to check
  - vault read azure/creds/jenkins
  this will provide clientid and clientsec which will be used for all next operation
  this cred is "contributor" role under azure rg "samg-jenkins"
